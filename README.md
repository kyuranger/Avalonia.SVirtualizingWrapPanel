Avalonia.SVirtualizingWrapPanel Project Description

This project introduces Avalonia.SVirtualizingWrapPanel, a custom VirtualizingWrapPanel designed for the Avalonia UI framework. Initially, I learned that the Avalonia Accelerate initiative planned to release a VirtualizingWrapPanel. To avoid naming conflicts, I named this implementation Avalonia.SVirtualizingWrapPanel.

As a hobbyist programmer, coding is not my primary profession but a passionate side pursuit. I developed this control because I needed a VirtualizingWrapPanel for my personal project and found no existing implementations online. Inspired by Avalonia's VirtualizingStackPanel, I built SVirtualizingWrapPanel from scratch based on my own ideas, without referencing the WrapPanel codebase. While functional, I acknowledge that my implementation may not match the performance or polish of the Avalonia team's official work. For those prioritizing top-tier performance and code quality, I recommend waiting for the official VirtualizingWrapPanel from Avalonia Accelerate.

Packaging this project as a NuGet package would enhance accessibility, but I lack the experience to do so. My time is limited due to a busy work and personal life, with most of my coding efforts focused on my personal projects, of which this control is just a small component. As a result, I haven't implemented certain features, such as GetIrregularSnapPoints and GetRegularSnapPoints, due to time and energy constraints. To use this control, simply copy the SVirtualizingWrapPanel class into your project. I will continue to maintain and fix bugs in this control as I encounter them in my own projects, but my capacity for extensive maintenance is limited.

This project is open-source and free to use. I welcome feedback, and if you're dissatisfied with the performance, code quality, or encounter bugs, feel free to fork the project and make your own improvements or optimizations.

I hope this project proves useful to the community and supports your development needs.
